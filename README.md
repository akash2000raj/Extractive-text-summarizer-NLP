## About Project

In recent years, an enormous amount of text data
from diversified sources has been emerged day-by-day. This huge
amount of data carries essential information and knowledge that
needs to be effectively summarized to be useful.Over the years so many 
tecniques have been discovered but almost all techniques have some cons 
not even a single tecnique is able to solve the challanges 
we face during text summarization process.

Four main chalanges are :
- Problem of Irrelevancy
- problem of redundancy
- problem of loss of coverage
- problem of less cohesive content

All above  mentioned problems are sort of connected with each other.
If you solve one problem the other problem might get automatically arised.
In this project we are mainly focusing on solving the
problem of Irrelevancy and providing our end users a short and relevant content.


 We are using[ Term Weight Approach](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258650563_Text_Summarization_Using_Term_Weights) in this project for summarization.
