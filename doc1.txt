Many people believe that aliens, or extraterrestrials, crash-landed near Roswell in July 1947. A rancher claimed that he found wreckage made of unusual metal that many think was from a flying saucer. The United States military collected the wreckage and at first announced that it was indeed from a flying saucer. However, soon after, military officials insisted a mistake had been made, and that the wreckage was from a weather balloon. For many people, the truth about the Roswell incident remains a mystery.
Anyone interested in UFOs and aliens would probably want to visit the International UFO Museum and Research Center, which was founded in 1991 in Roswell. UFO is an abbreviation for unidentified flying object, which is an object in the air that cannot be easily explained. Over the years, many people say they have seen UFOs. However, the objects usually turn out to be things that can be explained, such as meteors, balloons, or even birds.
